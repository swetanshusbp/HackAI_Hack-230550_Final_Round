# Stock Prediction
### Project Description
The Stock Prediction project is a Python-based application that analyzes stock trends and predicts future movements. It utilizes machine learning models trained on historical stock data. The application requires users to input valid stock tickers, which are then used to fetch data and perform predictions.

### Prerequisites

Python (3.6 or higher recommended)
Required Python Libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn
Access to stock data, preferably from Yahoo Finance Trending Tickers
Installation Instructions
Clone the Repository:
Clone the project repository to your local machine.

### Install Python Libraries:

Install the required Python libraries using pip:


pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Running the Project
### Fetch Stock Data:

Fetch stock data from a reliable source, such as Yahoo Finance(https://finance.yahoo.com/trending-tickers/?.tsrc=fin-srch).
Make sure to use valid stock tickers as input.

### Run the Script:
### Execute the main script:


python main.py
Replace main.py with the name of your Python script.

#### Using the Application:

Input the stock ticker symbols as instructed by the script.
The script will fetch the data, perform analysis, and output predictions.

### Special Considerations

Ensure that you have a stable internet connection to fetch stock data.
The accuracy of predictions depends on the quality and recency of the stock data used.
